Features of NTFS Protected Folder/File Access
----------------------------------------------

• NTFS Protected Folder/File Access is a useful and powerful tool, which provides you the access
  to any NTFS Protected Folder/File on your drives without resetting the permission of them.

• The tool can be used with NTFS-Formatted Removable drives as well.

• It provides a great interface to interact with its operations together with easy, efficient and effective usage.

• No matter how many files/folders are protected with NTFS on a drive(s), you will have instant access to them with 
  a single click.


------------------------------------------------
How does NTFS Protected Folder/File Access work?
------------------------------------------------

• NTFS Protected Folder/File Access uses a File System Filter Driver, which deals with NTFS Security Checks in order to
  accomplish this wonderful task. 


----------------------
You can use this tool,
-----------------------

• to instantly access any drive(s), which you get the message 'Access is denied' because of NTFS permission.

• to access folders/files when you mess up with NTFS permission of a drive.

• when you cannot take the ownership of folders/files on a drive to use them, because the drive is read only
  (Eg: read-only hard drive.) or mounted as read-only.

• when considering the time which takes to gain the ownership of millions of files of a drive in order to use them.

• to temporarily access folders/files which you cannot access or modify because of the guard provided by some of
  the security products on the market.

• to access the files which seem to have been corrupted because of NTFS permission.

• to access the NTFS protected Drives/Folders/Files, when you can not reset to access them because Security Tab 
  is missing on Properties and you can't get it reset due to Folder Options/Use simple file sharing is restricted or missing.


------------------------
How to use the program:
------------------------

• Click on 'Test Service Task' first. (Recommended) It will open 'System Volume Information' folder of your system drive,
  which you don't generally have access to. If not succeeded, click on 'Recover/Restore Filter Service'.

• Select drive(s)on which you have NTFS-Protected data, which you cannot access to.

• Then, click on 'Connect to Service'.

• Now you will wonderfully have access to NTFS-Protected data without resetting the permission of them.

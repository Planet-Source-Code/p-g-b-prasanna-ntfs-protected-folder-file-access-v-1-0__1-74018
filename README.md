### Description

NTFS Protected Folder/File Access is a useful and powerful tool, which provides you the access to any NTFS Protected Folder/File on your drives without resetting the permission of them. This is basically accomplished by using a File System Filter Driver, which deals with NTFS and the tool can be used,

â€¢ to instantly access any drive(s), which you get the message 'Access is denied' because of NTFS permission.

â€¢ to access folders/files when you mess up with NTFS permission of a drive.

â€¢ when you cannot take the ownership of folders/files on a drive to use them, because the drive is read only

(Eg: read-only hard drive.) or mounted as read-only.

â€¢ when considering the time which takes to gain the ownership of millions of files of a drive in order to use them.

â€¢ to temporarily access folders/files which you cannot access or modify because of the guard provided by some of

the security products on the market.

â€¢ to access the files which seem to have been corrupted because of NTFS permission.

â€¢ to access the NTFS protected data on NTFS-formatted removable drives as well.

â€¢ to access the NTFS protected Drives/Folders/Files, when you can not reset to access them because Security Tab is missing on properties and you can't get it reset

due to Folder Options/Use simple file sharing is restricted or missing.
